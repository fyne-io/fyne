// Package uri is meant to be an RFC 3986 compliant URI builder and parser.
//
// This is based on the work from ttacon/uri (credits: Trey Tacon).
//
// This fork concentrates on RFC 3986 strictness for URI parsing and validation.
//
// Reference: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986
//
// Tests have been augmented with test suites of URI validators in other languages:
// perl, python, scala, .Net.
//
// Extra features like MySQL URIs present in the original repo have been removed.
