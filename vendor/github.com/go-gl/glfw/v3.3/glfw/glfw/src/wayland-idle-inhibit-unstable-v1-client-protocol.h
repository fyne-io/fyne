 * This interface permits inhibiting the idle behavior such as screen
 * blanking, locking, and screensaving.  The client binds the idle manager
 * globally, then creates idle-inhibitor objects for each surface.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
 * backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
 * may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
 * Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
 * the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
 * Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
 * version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
 * interface version number is reset.

 * An idle inhibitor prevents the output that the associated surface is
 * visible on from being set to a state where it is not visually usable due
 * to lack of user interaction (e.g. blanked, dimmed, locked, set to power
 * save, etc.)  Any screensaver processes are also blocked from displaying.

 * visibility, or otherwise becomes not visually relevant for the user, the
 * idle inhibitor will not be honored by the compositor; if the surface
 * subsequently regains visibility the inhibitor takes effect once again.
 * Likewise, the inhibitor isn't honored if the system was already idled at
 * the time the inhibitor was established, although if the system later
 * de-idles and re-idles the inhibitor will take effect.
