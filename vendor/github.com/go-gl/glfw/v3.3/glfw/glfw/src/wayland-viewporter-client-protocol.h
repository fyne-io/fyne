 * @section page_iface_wp_viewport_desc Description
 *
 * An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
 * client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
 * contents.
 *
 * This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
 * src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
 * dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
 * destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
 * This state is double-buffered, and is applied on the next
 * wl_surface.commit.
 *
 * The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
 * rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
 * is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
 * used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
 * wl_surface.attach.
 *
 * If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
 * dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
 * this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
 * unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
 * has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
 * at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.
 *
 * If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
 * taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
 * size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
 * surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
 * without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
 * destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
 * the surface state is applied.
 *
 * The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
 * the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
 * 1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
 * 2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
 * 3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
 * This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
 * are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
 * i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
 * if the crop and scale was not applied.
 *
 * If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
 * Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
 * the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
 * when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
 * out_of_buffer error.
 *
 * If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
 * all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
 * no_surface.
 *
 * If the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
 * state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
 * on the next wl_surface.commit.
 * @section page_iface_wp_viewport_api API
