The luxi*.ttf and COPYING files in this directory were copied from the X.org
project, specifically
http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/font/font-bh-ttf-1.0.0.tar.bz2

There are three Luxi fonts: sans (s), serif (r) and monospaced (m). For example,
luxisr.ttf is Luxi Sans. The 'r' here means regular, as opposed to bold.

The *.ttx files in this directory were generated from the *.ttf files
by the ttx command-line tool.
http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html

The *-hinting.txt files in this directory were generated from the *.ttf files
by the ../cmd/print-glyph-points command-line tool.
