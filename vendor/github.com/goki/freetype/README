The Freetype font rasterizer in the Go programming language.

To download and install from source:
$ go get github.com/tdewolff/freetype

It is an incomplete port:
  * It only supports TrueType fonts, and not Type 1 fonts nor bitmap fonts.
  * It only supports the Unicode encoding.

There are also some implementation differences:
  * It uses a 26.6 fixed point co-ordinate system everywhere internally,
    as opposed to the original Freetype's mix of 26.6 (or 10.6 for 16-bit
    systems) in some places, and 24.8 in the "smooth" rasterizer.
